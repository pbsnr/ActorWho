```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
```

Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff
like applying [digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py) (think 'Meitu'):

```python
import face_recognition
known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("biden.jpg")
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")

biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)
```
