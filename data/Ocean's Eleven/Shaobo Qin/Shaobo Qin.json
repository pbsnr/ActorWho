Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company's international tours.::Katherine Stone", "trade mark": " ", "trivia": ["Touring with the Peking Acrobats around the United States.
