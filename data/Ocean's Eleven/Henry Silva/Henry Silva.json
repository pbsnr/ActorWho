{"name": "Henry Silva", "current role": "Boxing Spectator", "birth name": " ", "birth date": "1928-09-15", "birth place": "Brooklyn, New York, USA", "height": "6' 2\" (1.88 m)", "biography": "Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged Michael V. Gazzo's play \"A Hatful of Rain\" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students Ben Gazzara, Shelley Winters, Harry Guardino, Anthony Franciosa and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including The Bravados (1958), Green Mansions (1959), Ocean's 11 (1960), The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and Johnny Cool (1963).An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti Western, The Hills Run Red (1966), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted Charles Bronson to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with Frank Sinatra in the film Contract on Cherry Street (1977), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day \"to keep in shape and relieve tension\".::Anonymous", "trade mark": "Frequently played villains, for example Sharky's Machine (1981), Code of Silence (1985), Above the Law (1988), Dick Tracy (1990).", "trivia": ["Provides an audio commentary for the DVD version of The Return of Mr. Moto (1965) (part of the special features in Peter Lorre's Mr. Moto DVD collection). While making minimal comments about that movie itself, he does address the issue of his heritage. Wryly noting he had been assumed to be everything, including Russian, he specifically denied being of Puerto Rican heritage, which is the most commonly reported. He states that his mother was from Northern Spain and that his father was Italian. He was born in Brooklyn but left there when he was only five months old. His father left his mother when Silva was only three months old. Silva says that he was only eight years old when he decided to become an actor, although he didn't do anything about it until his teens. His inspiration was primarily his mother. Apparently, she was a storyteller and, upon returning from shopping, would fill their apartment with vivid characterizations of the grocer, baker etc. Silva concludes by noting that he thinks of his mother every day.", "The 1930 census lists him (as \"Harry\") living with his divorced mother in Manhattan. This census entry gives both his parents' birthplaces as \"Porto Rico\".", "Retired from acting in 2001 after 50 years in the motion picture industry.", "Has two sons from his marriage to Ruth Earl: Michael Henry Silva (B.

On one rare occasion he portrayed the titular hero in The Return of Mr. Moto and regarded this as his worst work ever.", "Did not learn to speak English until he was eight years old.", "Born in Spanish Harlem to poor Puerto Rican parents."], "filmography": ["Ocean's Eleven", "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai", "Justice", "Unconditional Love", "Superman: The Animated Series", "Buddy Faro", "The New Batman Adventures", "The End of Violence", "The Prince", "Mad Dog Time", "Drifting School", "Fatal Choice", "Batman: The Animated Series", "Possessed by the Night", "The Silence of the Hams", "South Beach", "Three Days to a Kill", "The Harvest", "The Last Match", "Dick Tracy", "Cy Warrior", "La via della droga", "Trained to Kill", "Fists of Steel", "Above the Law", "Bulletproof", "Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold", "Killer vs Killers", "Code of Silence", "The Manhunt", "Lust in the Dust", "Cannonball Run II", "The Violent Breed", "Happy", "Le Marginal", "Escape from the Bronx", "Chained Heat", "Megaforce", "Baker County, U.S.A.", "Wrong Is Right", "Sharky's Machine", "Alligator", "Day of Resurrection", "Le jour des assassins", "Thirst", "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", "Love and Bullets", "Quark", "Foxbat", "Contract on Cherry Street", "Assaut sur la ville", "Le Cave sort de sa planque", "MKS... 118", "Shoot", "Switch", "The Manhunt", "Buck le loup", "Kidnap", "Almost Human", "The F.B.I.
