{"name": "Clint Eastwood", "current role": "Walt Kowalski", "birth name": "Clinton Eastwood Jr.", "birth date": "1930-05-31", "birth place": "San Francisco, California, USA", "height": "6' 4\" (1.93 m)", "biography": "Clint Eastwood was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood, a housewife turned IBM operator. He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. When Eastwood was 19, his parents relocated to Washington state, and young Clint spent a couple years working menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest. Returning to California in 1951, he did a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-'50s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while simultaneously digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice for Clint's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967/68. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from television nonentity to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, Hang 'Em High (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan's Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly's Heroes (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a predatory Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the road adventures Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the fact-based prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Every Which Way but Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the '70s were uninterrupted success for Clint.Eastwood kicked off the '80s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and The Rookie (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).Eastwood bounced back--big time--with his dark western Unforgiven (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received A Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next up was a love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while True Crime (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.Eastwood surprised yet again in the mid-'00s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood's next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012). And between screen appearances, Clint chalked up a long and impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Changeling (2008) (a vehicle for screen megastar Angelina Jolie), Invictus (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and The 15:17 to Paris (2018). His latest project, in which he stars as an unlikely drug courier, is The Mule (2018), and after that he directed Richard Jewell (2019).Outside of work, Eastwood has led a hysterically convoluted existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His large number of partners and children are now reported matter-of-factually, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a long time relationship with equally enigmatic co-star Locke (deceased 2018), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Burney (in northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.::Scott- msa0510@mail.ecu.edu", "trade mark": "During the credits at the end of his movies, the camera will move around the location it was filmed in, after which there will be freezeframe for the rest of the credits.", "trivia": ["Lived with Sondra Locke from 1975 to 1989.", "Owns the Mission Ranch hotel & restaurant in Carmel, Calif., the exclusive Tehama golf club in Carmel Valley, and is partial owner of the Pebble Beach Golf Country Club in nearby Monterey Peninsula.", "Received an honorary Cesar award in Paris, France for his body of work.

But within a matter of weeks afterward, Johnson fell very ill with hepatitis and had to be hospitalized. Eastwood and Johnson reconciled, mutually understanding that it would be best if she turned a blind eye to his existing families (he also had a child in 1954 from a different affair), and in 1968, almost 15 years after they married, their first child together was born. Johnson was finally introduced to Tunis in 1972, outside Eastwood's presence, by a crew member on the set of Breezy (1973). The affair between Eastwood and Tunis is believed to have dissolved in the mid-seventies, around the time he and Sondra Locke got together. Tunis later appeared as an extra in Every Which Way but Loose (1978) as a member of the audience at LA's Palomino country-western club where Locke's character sings, but Eastwood didn't tell Locke about Kimber until 1983.

Locke described Eastwood as \"a monster who thought nothing of destroying anything inconvenient to him\" and likened the actor to O.J. Simpson. \"Others who knew Clint said that I had been 'far too kind' to him,\" she said of this evisceration. (Neither Eastwood or his publicist, Joe Hyams, would comment.) Locke reiterated previous testimony that Eastwood had manipulated her into having two abortions and sterilizing herself in the 1970s and that he sabotaged her directorial career after their 1989 split. But she also made a new allegation that he sired another woman's two children during the last three years of their relationship. The allegation of secret children was not even acknowledged by mainstream media, despite the fact that Locke's book exposed the kids' names and exact birth dates. Published reviews misrepresented the book by omitting its serious accusations and emphasizing trivial tidbits instead. (One anecdote widely printed in lieu of anything relevant was Eastwood's habit of asking \"Sweetie, did you floss?\" before they made love.) Locke learned of Eastwood's double life, she wrote, when an investigative journalist phoned her during depositions in the palimony case. The extraordinary revelation -- that Eastwood had a hidden family in Carmel, residing in a house under his business manager Roy Kaufman's name -- was confirmed in closed court after Locke filed a motion to discover and Eastwood's will was called in for evidence, with the document showing one Jacelyn Reeves and Reeves' legally fatherless son and daughter listed as beneficiaries.", "In April 1989, Sondra Locke filed a $70 million palimony lawsuit against Clint, after he changed the locks on their Bel-Air home and moved her possessions into storage while she was away directing Impulse (1990). The relationship had been on the rocks for months, with Clint leaving nonverbal hints that he wanted Sondra to get out of his life voluntarily (once, while she was still in the shower, he left to go to a party to which they'd both been invited), but they weren't officially broken up. During the 15 days between the lockout and Sondra filing suit, she tried to resolve things quietly, but Clint offered her nothing and would only communicate via lawyers. (To Sondra, an equal division of assets was principle rather than greed. She actually saved up $3 million over the course of her 14-year relationship with Clint because he was paying all their expenses.) Clint refused to say Sondra's name out loud at his depositions, reducing her to pronouns or alternately referring to her as \"the person.\" He also never made eye contact or any reference to her proximity in the courtroom. Sondra said the stress of the ordeal induced breast cancer, requiring mastectomies. In November 1990, 19 months into proceedings, she arranged to meet with Clint in private and achieved an immediate settlement. Sondra received $450,000 lump sum plus monthly support payments, title to a house in West Hollywood that Clint was leasing to her lawful wedded but openly gay husband Gordon Anderson, and a $1.5 million multi-year contract with Warner Bros. to develop and direct films. By the end of 1993, however, the studio had yet to provide Sondra with a single directorial assignment and rejected over 30 projects that she submitted. Sondra became convinced that the deal was a sham and that she was employed only on paper. \"I was stunned and outraged at the way I had been tricked and cheated\" she said. (Her attorney, Peggy Garrity, would later claim Clint held out the Warner deal like a \"dangled carrot\" to get her to drop the palimony suit.) Sondra sued Clint again for fraud in June 1995, having unearthed a bookkeeping printout to corroborate the charge. She asserted that the money WB pretended they were paying her came from Clint's own pocket and was laundered through the operating budget for Unforgiven (1992). The case went to trial in September 1996, with one juror disclosing that the panel agreed to find for Sondra by a 10-to-2 vote (nine votes are needed for a verdict) and were only debating the amount. Clint's legal team convinced him to settle at the eleventh hour, and on the morning jurors were set to begin a second day of deliberation, Sondra announced her decision to drop her suit against Clint in return for an unspecified monetary reward. As Clint walked down the courthouse steps, he told a bank of cameras, \"What does this say to young women across the country who work very hard for a living?\" (A nonsensical remark, since the case he had just lost was all about work--work he obstructed his ex-soulmate from doing.) Sondra then brought a separate action against Warner Brothers, seeking $100 million in damages for conspiring with Clint to ruin her career. It was settled out of court in May 1999, ending the decade-long legal saga. While she was bound by confidentiality not to reveal the amount, Locke wasn't shy about disclosing her feelings. \"I feel elated.

On the other hand, it was Reynolds who sent Clint a copy of \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\", later made into a film by Eastwood (The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)).

I had publicly exposed him,\" she commented in retrospect.) The breakup with Locke opened the floodgates to investigative journalism about Eastwood. In July 1989, the National Enquirer reported the existence of a love child he fathered in 1964, and in February 1990, the Star tabloid became the first publication to link Eastwood's name with Jacelyn Reeves--who, it turns out, was the mother of two of his unmentionable offspring. Reputable news outlets wouldn't touch this information for years after. Almost certainly, his career would have suffered had this become public knowledge during the fact.

Los Angeles Times critic Allen Barra called it \"perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet written on modern Hollywood.\" On Christmas Eve 2002, Eastwood's lawyer Marshall Grossman filed a $10 million libel suit against McGilligan and St. Martin's Press in San Jose, California. Strangely enough, out of all the sordid stories in the book, the libel claim only covered three points, according to news reports: (1) That Eastwood once punched his first wife Maggie Johnson in the face; (2) That Eastwood is an atheist; (3) That Eastwood used a romantic relationship with an officer's daughter in order to avoid being sent overseas during the Korean conflict. The suit was settled in July 2004 without any public disclosure; McGilligan and the publisher admitted no wrongdoing and there was no penalty. A revised and updated version of \"Clint\" was published in 2015, with most of the original content intact.
