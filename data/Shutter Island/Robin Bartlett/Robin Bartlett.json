Bartlett gave an emotionally gripping performance as one of several female prisoners to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where she and a group of female classical musicians were spared in return for performing for their captors.Over the course of her career, she's worked with talented moviemaking mavericks, including Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese, and received award nominations for unique performances.It might appear that Bartlett prefers theater but she continues to dabble in film and television, and whichever role, small or large, delivers with deliberation and exquisite artistry.::arv.0705@gmail.com", "trade mark": " ", "trivia": ["Played a teacher at least twice-as Mrs. Elliott in Lean on Me (1989), then again as French teacher Mrs. Grober in If Looks Could Kill (1991).
